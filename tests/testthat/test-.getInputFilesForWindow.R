# TODO: These tests would be much easier to run if you split the function s.t.
#       1. getting the output filepaths
#       2. getting the small files per window
#       3. writing out the files

# test_that("Number of windows are correct", {
#         #Check whether RV_TDT has correct dimensions for input files
#         #Check a few different window sizes (0, 10, 300, 1000)
# })

# test_that("Size of windows are correct", {
#         #Check whether the sizes of the windows for MAP are correct
#         #Check whether the size of the windows for TPED are correct
